# Clima

This is a beautiful, dark-mode enabled weather app. It's able to check the weather for the current location based on the GPS data from the iPhone as well as by searching for a city manually.
Please make sure that you have a valid Api Key in the weatherURL constant before run the App. (It's in gitignore).
